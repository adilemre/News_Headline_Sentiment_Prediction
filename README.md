# News_Headline_Sentiment_Prediction
In this analysis, I worked on a textual dataset from Kaggle.

The dataset has 4.8 rows and 2 features; news headlines and the sentiment label (Positive, Neutral, Negative).

The purpose of this analysis is creating a predictive model to estimate the sentiment in a newsheadline.

I started with the preprocessing steps and then continued to the modelling part. As a final outcome, I had a neural network model with %82 accuracy, %89 precision and %84 recall score.

As I was doing this analysis, I remember what we all know, preprocessing is crucial and it really makes difference in the model performance results.

The python notebook in Kaggle is below. If you like to take a look at the notebook and share your comments, you are welcome.
